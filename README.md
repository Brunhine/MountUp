## Usage
*In this example, we will be using a rider and a mount and rider scenario, but this could be anything like driving or carrying. You can even change the icons used by the module to fit your game.* 

### Mounting
To mount a token:
1. Select the "rider" and the "mount" tokens.
2. Right click on the "mount" icon to bring up the token HUD.
3. Click on the horse icon (you can change this in your game).\
![dismount example](/examples/mount-example.webm)\
*The rider will now be linked to the mount. Anywhere the mount moves, the rider follows.*

### Dismounting
To dismount a token from a token:
1. Right click on the "mount" to bring up the token HUD. 
2. Click on the dismount icon.\
